## What This Project Is

A web-based B2B furniture configurator SaaS. Users create projects, configure furniture (dimensions, materials, slots), confirm configurations, generate DXF/PDF production files, and dispatch orders to a CRM via webhook. Designed for furniture manufacturers to offer parametric configuration + production pipeline to their clients.

Inspired by [b2b.pan-raspil.ru](https://b2b.pan-raspil.ru/) with a fuller stack: PBR 3D preview, multi-tenant material catalog, BOM engine, export pipeline, CRM bridge.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| 3D viewer | Babylon.js (basic panel preview — see gaps) |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python 3.12), async |
| Auth | NextAuth v5 (frontend) + custom JWT (backend), RBAC |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 via SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + asyncpg |
| Migrations | Alembic (5 migrations) |
| File storage | S3-compatible (boto3); local dev uses MinIO or moto mocks |
| DXF export | `ezdxf` |
| PDF export | `WeasyPrint` |
| CRM dispatch | HTTP webhook (configurable per tenant) |
| Containerization | Docker Compose (Postgres + MinIO + backend + frontend) |

## What Has Been Built (Sub-plans 1–20)

All 25 implementation plans have been executed. Zero unchecked tasks remain.

### Backend (sub-plans 1–4, 6)
- **Auth**: register, login, JWT, RBAC (admin / manufacturer / designer / consumer roles)
- **Projects**: CRUD, room schema JSONB storage, user ownership
- **Furniture Types**: CRUD, JSON schema storage per category
- **Configurations**: CRUD, status machine (`draft → confirmed → in_production → completed`), per-project scoping
- **Materials**: CRUD, PBR texture upload (ZIP with albedo/normal/roughness/AO), S3 storage, per-tenant + global catalog
- **Pricing engine**: panel area × price/m², edge banding, hardware, labour, tenant margin
- **BOM engine**: cut list with dimensions, grain direction, edge banding flags
- **Orders**: creation (triggers DXF + PDF export to S3), status, per-tenant `project_id` in response
- **Webhook/CRM dispatch**: POST to tenant-configured URL with configurable payload fields
- **Tenant settings**: GET/PUT `/tenants/me` — margin, webhook URL, CRM config
- **Backend tests**: 123 tests across 17 test files

### Frontend (sub-plans 5, 7–20)
All pages use Next.js 15 App Router with Server Components + Server Actions. No client-side API calls — all data fetching is server-side.

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/login`, `/register` | Auth pages (NextAuth v5 credentials) |
| `/projects` | Projects list with "New Project" |
| `/projects/new` | Create project form |
| `/projects/[id]` | Project detail: room schema summary, configs grid, delete |
| `/projects/[id]/edit` | Rename project |
| `/projects/[id]/room-schema/edit` | Edit room schema (JSON textarea — see gaps) |
| `/projects/[id]/configurations/new` | Pick furniture type + set dimensions + assign panel materials |
| `/projects/[id]/configurations/[cfgId]` | 3D viewer (Babylon.js) + confirm/delete/download links |
| `/projects/[id]/configurations/[cfgId]/preview` | Pricing + BOM preview, Place Order button |
| `/projects/[id]/orders/[orderId]` | Order detail with DXF/PDF links + CRM dispatch button |
| `/configurations` | Global configurations list (all projects) with delete for drafts |
| `/orders` | Global orders list |
| `/materials` | Materials catalog list |
| `/materials/new` | Create material + upload PBR ZIP |
| `/materials/[matId]` | Material detail with inline edit |
| `/furniture-types` | Furniture types list |
| `/furniture-types/new` | Create furniture type with JSON schema editor |
| `/furniture-types/[ftId]` | Furniture type detail |
| `/furniture-types/[ftId]/edit` | Edit furniture type schema |
| `/settings` | Tenant webhook + CRM + margin config |
| `/dashboard` | Redirects to `/projects` (backward-compat shim) |

- **Frontend tests**: 57 Jest tests in `frontend/tests/lib/api.test.ts`

## What Is NOT Built (Gaps vs Master Design Spec)

These are features described in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-08-furniture-constructor-design.md` that have not been implemented. They are the natural next areas of work.

### High Priority (core product gaps)

**1. 2D Room Planner Canvas**
The design spec describes an HTML5 Canvas + SVG overlay for visually drawing room walls, placing doors/windows, snapping to grid. The current implementation (`/projects/[id]/room-schema/edit`) is a **raw JSON textarea** — users paste room schema JSON manually. The visual drawing tool was never built.
- Design file: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-08-furniture-constructor-design.md` → Module 1

**2. Full Parametric 3D Builder (BabylonScene)**
The current `BabylonScene.tsx` renders a simplified 6-panel box (left side, right side, top, bottom, back, one shelf) scaled from `width`/`height`/`depth`. It does **not** implement:
- The full `FurnitureSchema` slot system (`open | shelf | door_single | door_double | lift_up | drawer | pull_out | glass_insert`)
- CSG operations (handle cutouts, hinge pockets)
- Hardware mesh instances (hinges, handles, drawer slides)
- Column/row grid layout
- Rendering from actual `applied_config.panels[]` (the config form saves panel assignments but the viewer ignores them)

**3. PBR Texture Application in 3D Viewer**
`BabylonScene.tsx` uses hardcoded `PBRMaterial` colors (`albedoColor`). The material textures uploaded to S3 (albedo, normal, roughness, AO maps) are **never loaded in the viewer**. Each panel's `material_id` is stored in `applied_config` but the Babylon scene doesn't fetch or apply the actual S3 textures.

**4. Room Placement / Furniture-in-Room Scene**
No room 3D scene exists. The viewer shows furniture in isolation on a ground plane. The design spec describes placing confirmed furniture pieces into the 3D room scene (built from `RoomSchema`) with Havok physics collision and wall-snapping. This was never built.

### Medium Priority

**5. SVG Export / Panel Nesting**
The design spec lists SVG as a third export format — a cut optimization layout minimizing sheet waste via a nesting algorithm (`svgwrite` + custom nesting). Only DXF and PDF are implemented. `export_urls` currently only has `{ dxf, pdf }`.

**6. Zustand State Management**
The design spec listed Zustand for 3D scene state. The current implementation uses React `useState` throughout. Not a blocker for functionality but will be needed when the configurator becomes more complex (multi-piece room, undo/redo, shared state between 3D and sidebar).

**7. Redis**
Mentioned in the design for caching and WebSocket support. Not installed or used anywhere. No caching layer exists.

**8. Admin UI**
The `admin` role exists in the RBAC system but there are no admin-specific frontend pages. Admins can use the API directly but there's no UI for:
- Managing tenants
- Viewing/editing the global material library
- User management

**9. Manufacturer Role Distinction**
The manufacturer role exists but behaves identically to other roles in the frontend. The design spec describes a separate manufacturer portal for managing their catalog and receiving production orders.

## Key Files

| File | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/api/orders.py` | Most complex endpoint — creates order, generates DXF+PDF, uploads to S3, stores URLs |
| `backend/app/core/pricing.py` | Pricing engine pure function |
| `backend/app/core/bom.py` | BOM engine pure function |
| `backend/app/core/export_dxf.py` | DXF panel drawing via ezdxf |
| `backend/app/core/export_pdf.py` | PDF generation via WeasyPrint |
| `backend/app/core/webhook.py` | CRM payload builder + dispatch |
| `frontend/lib/api.ts` | All API types + fetch functions — the frontend's contract with the backend |
| `frontend/app/(app)/layout.tsx` | App shell: nav links, sign-out |
| `frontend/app/(app)/projects/[id]/configurations/[cfgId]/_components/BabylonScene.tsx` | 3D viewer — main area for future 3D work |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-08-furniture-constructor-design.md` | Master product design spec — the source of truth for what this should eventually be |

## Running Locally (macOS, no Docker)

**Prerequisites:** PostgreSQL running, MinIO running (or skip for no export)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create backend/.env:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost/furniture_constructor
#   SECRET_KEY=<openssl rand -base64 32>
#   S3_BUCKET=furniture-constructor
#   S3_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin / S3_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
#   S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
# Create frontend/.env.local:
#   AUTH_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 32>
#   AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
#   BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running on Ubuntu Server (Docker, accessible from MacBook on LAN)

```bash
# On Ubuntu machine:
# 1. Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker

# 2. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/rovshen89/test_claude.git && cd test_claude

# 3. Check for port conflicts (3000, 8000, 9001)
ss -tlnp | grep -E ':3000|:8000|:9001'
# If any are taken, set FRONTEND_PORT / BACKEND_PORT / MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT in .env

# 4. Create .env (auto-fills secrets and IP)
cat > .env << EOF
SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
AUTH_URL=http://$(ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -1):3000
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
BACKEND_PORT=8000
MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT=9001
EOF

# 5. Build and start
docker compose up --build -d

# 6. Watch logs
docker compose logs -f
```

Open `http://<ubuntu-ip>:3000` from MacBook.

**Notes:**
- Postgres and MinIO are internal only — no host ports exposed for them.
- `migrate` and `createbuckets` are one-shot init containers — they exit with code 0 on success.
- All data is persisted in Docker volumes (`postgres_data`, `minio_data`). `docker compose down -v` wipes them.

## Suggested Next Steps

Priority order based on what's most visible to users:

1. **Visual room planner** — replace the JSON textarea at `/projects/[id]/room-schema/edit` with an HTML5 Canvas drawing tool. This is the largest UX gap between what's built and what the product spec describes.

2. **Full parametric 3D builder** — extend `BabylonScene.tsx` to render from `applied_config.panels[]` with the correct per-panel dimensions from `FurnitureSchema`. Apply S3 material textures to each panel using the stored `material_id`.

3. **SVG panel nesting export** — add a third export format to the order pipeline. `export_urls` already has the `dxf`/`pdf` shape; add `svg`.

4. **Admin UI** — pages under `/admin` for tenant management, global material library, user overview.

5. **Zustand** — once the 3D configurator grows in complexity, add Zustand for shared state between the canvas, sidebar controls, and panel assignment list.
